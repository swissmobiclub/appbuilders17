# App Builders Scholarships
During the first version of App Builders, we offered a limited number of tickets to students at a discounted price. It turned out to be a great decision as we welcomed students from all over Europe.

We are very busy working on App Builders 2017 and we want to provide more help to students. We would like to inspire them in contributing to the community, learning the newest technologies and meeting new amazing people. For this reason, we are excited to announce the **App Builders 2017 Scholarships**.
### Applying
We want to help students be part of the community. To apply for a scholarship, **you will need to contribute to an open-source project**. No matter your experience with Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin or Java. Pick a project you are excited about and **try to help** in any way you can. This could include fixing typos, writing documentation, helping someone else in a Github issue, opening a new issue or even opening a pull request. You're also welcome to create a new open-source project if you want. 
Once you feel proud of your contribution, you can apply for a scholarship by filling out [our application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19pRTVksY4-1XwuTlGxjg5FmaylN4f4NKJMSQZVxrs4I/).

### Deadline
We will stop accepting applications on February 19th, 2017. We will let you know about the status of your application by February 24th, 2017.

### Eligibility
If you are a student (part-time or full-time), you are eligible for an App Builders Scholarship. No matter if you're in middle school, high school or attending a university.

### Award
5 winners will be awarded based on the talent and the creativeness of their submission with a free ticket for App Builders 2017. The ticket will provide access to both days of the conference on April 24-25th 2017 in Lausanne. We are not able to assist with your trip and accommodation unfortunately.

### Student Ticket Discount
Special student tickets can still be purchased if you prefer not to take part in the scholarship program at a discounted price of 99 CHF. We have a limited number of students tickets available on a first-come, first-served basis.
